# Feedback Analysis
Feedback Analysis is a tool to analyze textual feedback
and produce short, meaningful highlights that characterize sentiment. This repo contains the code used to design
the underlying NLP system which is discussed in further detail below.
## Motivation
For many organizations, feedback forms are used to measure the quality of experience from a customer or employee's
standpoint. Often times, insights expressed in feedback can help develop new solutions, reinforce positive behavior,
evaluate errors, and promote overall growth for the organization. Therefore, from small clubs to large corporations,
reading feedback is a critical component of enhancing performance.

However, reading a large number of feedback forms can quickly become cumbersome. For instance, in my high school, clubs
received 100-150 responses from students. The officers of that club would have to read hundreds of paragraphs, and a lot
of this time was spent on reading unimportant details. Motivated by this, I developed this tool to analyze feedback and
highlight spans of text that express strong sentiment, as this is where feedback is likely to be useful.
